# Algerian Forest Data Analysis and Linear Regression Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Algerian Forest Data Analysis and Linear Regression Project! This project aims to analyze forest fire data from Algeria and build a predictive model using linear regression. The goal is to understand the factors contributing to forest fires and predict future occurrences to aid in prevention and resource allocation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various attributes related to forest fires in Algeria, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. The data is collected from multiple regions, providing a comprehensive view of the factors influencing forest fires.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering and preprocessing the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding the data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve the model.
4. **Model Building**: Implementing linear regression to predict forest fires.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the model.
6. **Conclusion**: Summarizing findings and potential improvements.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/misrapk/AlgerianForestFire_Project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd AlgerianForestFire
```

3. Run the analysis script:

```bash
python analysis.py
```

## Results

The project provides insights into the key factors affecting forest fires in Algeria and presents a linear regression model to predict the likelihood of future fires. The results are visualized through various plots and charts for better understanding.
